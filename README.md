This repository is no longer being updated!

‚ö†Ô∏è **Migration is mandatory if you want to receive regular updates for eth-docker**

How can I migrate?

1. Go to your eth-docker folder
2. Change the origin remote repo:
```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/eth-educators/eth-docker
```
3. Change `COMPOSE_FILE` variable value in your `.env` file: you should change `lido-deposit-cli.yml` to `deposit-cli.yml`
```
sed -i '/^COMPOSE_FILE=/s/lido-deposit-cli.yml/deposit-cli.yml/' .env
```
4. Run update
```

## Version

Eth Docker uses a "semver-ish" scheme.
- First digit, major shifts in how things work. The last one was Ethereum merge. I do not expect another shift that
large.
- Second through fourth digit, [semver](https://semver.org/).

This is Eth Docker v2.12.2.0
